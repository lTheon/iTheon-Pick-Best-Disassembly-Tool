# iTheon's Pick Best Disassembly Tool
This mod aims to improve the logic of selecting the best disassembly tool in Stalker Anomaly. Instead of choosing the first in line, it chooses the tool with the highest condition available. Compared to Demonized's version, this one does iterate over all the disassembly tools you've got in your inventory (Demonized's version would first always choose the best Multitool and then start using the other tools once all Multitools are gone). It also makes the tool selection based on condition apply to weapon disassembling.
